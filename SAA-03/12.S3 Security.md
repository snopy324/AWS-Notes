## 12. S3 Security

### Server-Side Encryption
- Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) – Enabled by Default
  - Keys handled, managed, and owned by AWS
  - AES-256
  - Header: {"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"}
- Server-Side Encryption with KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)
  - Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encryption keys
  - KMS advantages: user control + audit key usage using CloudTrail
  - Header: {"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"}
  - Increase cost by calling KMS API when encrypting and decrypting
  - Limit by 5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region, increase quota in Service Quotas Console
- Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
  - Your own encryption keys, AWS do not store key for user
  - HTTPS only, provide key in header with every request
- Client-Side Encryption
  - Fully customer-side action

### Summary
- HTTP / HTTPS support. HTTPS only for SSE-C
- Use aws:SecureTransport for Force Encryption in Transit (HTTPS)
- Able to use policy to force encryption
- **Note: Bucket Policies are evaluated before “Default Encryption”**
- CORS Policy can be set to response header (Origin = scheme (protocol) + host (domain) + port)

### MFA Delete
- Versioning must be enabled
- MFA will be needed for:
  - Permanently delete object version
  - Suspend Versioning
- Only root account can enable/disable MFA Delete

### Access Logs
- Audit log for Bucket-A can be stored in Bucket-B, **must be in the same region**
- **Do not store into log-bucket, cause trigger looping**

### S3 Glacier Vault Lock
- Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
- Create a Vault Lock Policy
- Lock the policy for future edits (can no longer be changed or deleted)
- Helpful for compliance and data retention

### S3 Object Lock (versioning must be enabled)
- Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
- Block an object version deletion for a specified amount of time
- Retention mode - Compliance:
  - Object versions can't be overwritten or deleted, including the root user
  - Retention periods can't be shortened
- Retention mode - Governance:
  - Some users have special permissions to change the retention or delete the object
- Retention Period: protect the object for a fixed period, it can be extended
- Legal Hold:
  - Protect the object indefinitely, independent from retention period
  - Can be freely placed and removed using the s3:PutObjectLegalHold IAM permission

### S3 – Access Points – VPC Origin
- Define the access points for simplify security management
- DNS for each access point

### S3 Object Lambda
- Change object before retrieved to caller
