# 17. AWS Messaging

## SQS - Simple Queue Service

- Queue
- Decouples applications
- Attributes
- Unlimited throughput, unlimited messages number
- Limitation of 256KB per message
- May have duplicate messages
- May not be in order
- Message needs to be deleted by consumer
- Retention up to 14 days, default 4 days
- Message Visibility Timeout
    - After message is polled by consumer, message is marked as invisible to others
    - Multiple consumers can parallel message without re-processing the same data
    - Default is 30 sec
    - Can be changed by API **ChangeMessageVisibility**
- Long Polling
    - Listens to the queue (WaitTimeSeconds 1-20 sec)
- CloudWatch Metric
    - Queue Length triggers CloudWatch Alarm
    - Auto Scaling Group does the scaling
- Decouples applications
    - FIFO Queue
    - First In First Out
    - Throughput limited to 300 msg/s, batch 3000 msg/s
    - Does not have duplicate messages

## SNS - Simple Notification Service

- Similar to Kafka at high level?
- Message can be received by multiple subscribers
- Uses topics to categorize messages
- 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic, 100,000 topic limit
- FIFO
    - Ordered by Group ID (same group are ordered)
    - Deduplication using a Deduplication ID
    - Only SQS FIFO as subscribers
- Limited throughput (same throughput as SQS FIFO)

### SNS & SQS Fan Out

- Message -> SNS -> multiple SQS
- No data loss
- Works with SQS from other regions
- S3 Event
    - Same event type and prefix can have **one S3 Event result**
    - Use Fan Out if want to send to multiple SQS

### Message Filtering

- Supports for Message Attributes & Message Body

## Kinesis Overview

- For collecting, processing, and analyzing streams in real-time
- Kinesis Data Stream - capture, process, store stream
- Kinesis Data Firehose - load data to AWS services
- Kinesis Data Analytics - analyze stream with SQL or Apache Flink
- Kinesis Video Stream - capture, process, store video stream

### Kinesis Data Streams

- Retention up to 365 days
- Can reprocess data
- Data can't be deleted
- Uses **Shard** as partition, same partition goes to same shard and ordering
- Provisioned Mode
    - Shard has 1MB/s in, 2MB/s out
    - Pay for shard provisioned per hour
- On-demand Mode
    - Default capacity provisioned (4 MB/s in or 4000 records per second)
    - Pay for data in/out per GB
- Monitor API calls from CloudTrail

### Kinesis Data Firehose

- Fully managed service, no admin, auto scaling, serverless
- Targets:
    - AWS - Redshift / S3 / OpenSearch
    - 3rd party - Splunk / MongoDB / DataDog / NewRelic ...
    - Custom - any HTTP endpoint
- **Near Real Time -** 60sec latency minimum for non-batches
- 1 MB of data at least
- Able to combine with AWS Lambda
- Fail log back to S3

### Kinesis Data Streams vs Firehose

| Kinesis Data Streams | Kinesis Data Firehose         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Streaming service    | Load streaming data to others |
| Custom code          | Fully managed                 |
| Real-time (<200ms)   | Near real-time (60sec)        |
| Data storaged        | No data storaged              |
| Replay capability    | No replay capability          |

### Ordering data to Kinesis vs SQS

Case : 100 trucks, 5 Kinesis shards, 1 SQS FIFO

### Kinesis

- Using **Partition key** as dictionary key to hash and find the shard to store
- Avg - 20 truck in a shard
- Ordered in each shard
- Max consumer is 5
- Receive data of 5MB/s

### SQS

- SQS standard - no ordering
- SQS FIFO - use **Group ID** as dictionary key, if no group id then only one consumer is available
- Can up to 100 Group ID
- Can up to 100 consumer
- Can up to 300 message (3000 if batching)

## Amazon MQ

- Migrate will legacy code who use MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
- Like RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ
- Perform not like SNS/SQS
- Can use multi-AZ
