19. Serverless

Only deploy functions, no managed required.

## Serverless in AWS
- AWS Lambda
- DynamoDB
- AWS Cognito
- AWS API Gateway
- Amazon S3
- AWS SNS & SQS
- AWS Kinesis Data Firehose
- Aurora Serverless
- Step Functions
- Fargate


## AWS Lambda
- Only functions
- Run on-demand
- Auto scaling
- Serverless CRON Job - schedule job
- Easy pricing!!!
  - First 1,000,000 call is free
  - First 400,000 GB-sec of CPU is free
- Memory limit 128MB-10GB
- Time limit 15 mins top
- Env variables 4KB
- Disk capacity 512MB - 10GB
- Concurrency execution  instance 1000
- By default is run outside VPC
- Use **RDS Proxy** to access RDS, avoiding database connection pool exhaustion, must be in VPC - cause Proxy is never public accessible
- **PostgreSQL & Aurora MySQL** can create **data events** for Lambda
- **RDS Event** if for DB instance, not involve data events, near real-time

## CloudFront Functions & Lambda@Edge
- Code attach and run at edge, reducing latency
- Use case
    - Custom CDN content
    - Website Security and Privacy
    - Dynamic Web Application at the Edge
    - Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
    - Intelligently Route Across Origins and Data Centers
    - Bot Mitigation at the Edge
    - Real-time Image Transformation
    - A/B Testing
    - User Authentication and Authorization
    - User Prioritization
    - User Tracking and Analytics

## CloudFront Functions
- In JavaScript
- Sub-ms startup time, **millions req pre sec**
- Change **Viewer Req/Res** (Client <-Viewer Content-> CloudFront <-Origin Content-> Server)

## Lambda@Edge
- Scale **1000s of req/res**
- Change both **Viewer and Origin content**

Use Case
- Cloud Front Funtions
- Cache Key normalization
- Header manipulation
- URL rewrite or redirects
- Request authentication & authorization
- Lambda@Edge
- Longer exection time (to ms)
- Access to other AWS service 
- Access HTTP body

## Amazon DynamoDB
- NoSQL - transaction support
- Millons request/sec, 100s TB stroage
- High performacne
- Standard & Infrequent Access (IA) Table Class
- Made of **Tables**
- Must have **Primary Key**
- Max size of item is 400KB
- Data type
  - Scalar Types – String, Number, Binary, Boolean, Null
  - Document Types – List, Map
  - Set Types – String Set, Number Set, Binary Set
- Read Capacity Units (RCU) & Write Capacity Units (WCR) is depart

## DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
- Cache for DynamoDB
- 5 mins TTL for default

## DynamoDB Features
- DynamoDB Stream - Low version of Kinesis Data Steam
- DynamoDB Global Tables 
  - Active-Active replication in multi-regions
  - Can **Read & Write** in any region
  - Must enable DynamoDB Streams for pre-requisite
- DynamoDB TTL - Auto delete items after TTL
- Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) in 35 days
- Recovery process creates new table
- No read/write capcacity affect to table, when import/export to S3


## AWS API Gateway
- API vversioning support
- WebSocket Protocol support
- Cache API response
- Target to 
- Lambda Function
- HTTP endpoints
- AWS Service
- Endpoints Types
- Edge-Optimized - request is routed through CloudFront Edge, API Gateway is still live in one - region
- Regional - For client in same region
- Private - Access from VPC only
- Security
- User Authentication through
- IAM, Cognito, Custom Authorizer
- Custom Domain Name HTTPS - integrate AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- If using Edge-Optimized endpoint, must in **us-east-1**
- If using Regional endpoint, certificate must in same region
- Must setup CNAME or A-alias for Route 53


## AWS Step Functions
Features - sequence, parallel, conditions, timeouts, error handling, …


## Amazon Cognito
- Cognito User Pools - sign in function for app users
- Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identity) - provide temporary identities for users
- "hundreds of users", "mobile users", "authenticate with SAML"
