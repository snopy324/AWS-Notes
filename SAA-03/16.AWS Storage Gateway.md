# 16. AWS Storage Gateway

## Use cases

- Disaster recovery
- Back up & restore
- Tiered storage
- On-premise cache

## S3 File Gateway

- Cached most recently used file
- Not support S3 Glacier, use lifecycle policy instead
- SMD with AD is integrate for user auth

## FSx file Gateway

- Local cache for frequently accessed data
- Windows native compatibility

## Volume Gateway

- iSCSI back by S3 and EBS snapshots
- Cached volumes - low latency
- Stored volumes - scheduled backup to S3

## Tape Gateway

- Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes (!)
- With Tape Gateway, companies use the same processes but, in the cloud
- Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier
- Back up data using existing tape-based processes (and iSCSI interface)
- Works with leading backup software vendors

## Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance

If you have no on-premises gateway, buy it on amazon.com

## AWS Transfer Family
