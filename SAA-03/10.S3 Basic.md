# 10. S3 Basics

# **Buckets**

- Like root directories
- Has to be globally unique name (cross all region, cross all account)
- Region service
- No prefix "xn--", no suffix "-s3alias"

## **Objects**

- Files
- Actually no directory in S3 (UI just for display purpose), just keys
- **`key = prefix + object name`**
- Example: **`s3://my-bucket/my-folder1/my-folder2/my-file.txt`**
    - Prefix: **`my-folder1/my-folder2/`**
    - Object name: **`my-file.txt`**
- Max size up to 5TB per object
- Uploading 5GB must use multi-part upload (recommended multi-part for > 100MB)

## **Security**

- User-Based - IAM Policies
- Resource-Based
- Bucket Policies - allow cross account (format like IAM Policies)
- Object Access Control List (ACL)
- Bucket Access Control List (ACL)
- Disable **Bucket settings for Block Public Access** if bucket should never be public

## **Versioning**

- Bucket level feature
- Best practice to version bucket
- Object version is null, if object is uploaded before enabling versioning
- Delete on versioning object only adds a **Delete marker**

## **Replication**

- Must enable versioning
- Cross-Region Replication
- Same-Region Replication
- Bucket can cross accounts
- Asynchronous
- Use case:
    - CRR – compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
    - SRR – log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts
- Only new object will be replica when feature enabled
- Can replicate **delete markers**
- Deletions on version ID are not replicated
- No chaining replication on same object (A ---> B -X-> C)

## **Durability and Availability**

- 99.999999999% (11 9's) reachable on S3
- 10,000,000 object on S3, loss a single object every 10,000 year
- Same cross all storage classes
- Can be moved between classes
- Availability depending on storage class
