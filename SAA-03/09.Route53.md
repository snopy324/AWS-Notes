### Domain Registrar & DNS Service

- If you buy your domain on a 3rd party registrar, you can still use Route 53 as the DNS Service provider
1. Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53
2. Update NS Records on 3rd party website to use Route 53 Name Servers

• Domain Registrar != DNS Service
• But every Domain Registrar usually comes with some DNS features
