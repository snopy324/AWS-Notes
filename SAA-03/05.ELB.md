# 5. ELB - Elastic Load Balancer

## **Health Check**

- Enable load balancer flow to the target if health check pass
- Target is defined on port and path
- Can pass on status code 200

## **Load Balancers**

- Classic Load Balancer
    - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL
- Application Load Balancer
    - HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
    - Support redirects (HTTP to HTTPS for example)
    - Routing base on path, hostname, querystring, Http header
    - Support EC2 instance, ECS task, Lambda, private IP
    - Can route to multi target group
    - Client informance will be inserted in http header X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Port, X-Forwarded-Proto
- Network Load Balancer
    - TCP, TLS, UDP
    - Performance milions request per second
    - Less latency ~ 100ms (400ms for ALB)
    - NLB has one static IP per AZ, support assigning Elastic IP (good for whitelisting)
- Gateway Load Balancer
    - Operate at layer 3 (Network layer) - IP Protocol
    - Not a real load balancer function
    - Deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS
    - Example: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, Deep Packet Inspection Systems, payload manipulation
    - User => Gateway => 3rd party appliances (firewall) => Gateway => application
    - Some can be setup as internal or external

## **Target Group**

- EC2
- Auto Scaling Group
- IP Addresses - private IPs only
- Application Load Balancer
- Health Check support TCP, HTTP, HTTPS

## **Sticky Sessions**

- Application-based Cookies
    - Custom cookie - Don't use AWS as prefix
    - Application cookie is AWSALBPAPP
- Duration-based Cookies
    - AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB

## **Cross-Zone Load Balancing**

- Enable - distributes evenly across all registered instances in all AZ
- Disable - distributed in the instances of the node of the Elastic Load Balancer
- ALB - enable by default
- NLB - disable by default, charge is enable even inter AZ
- CLB - disable by default

## **SNI - Server Name Indication**

- Handle the problem of multi SSL certificate on one server
- Only support ALB & NLB (newer gen), CloudFront

## **Connection Draining**

- Timeout of connection to de-registering or unhealthy
- Naming for following
    - CLB - Connection Draining
    - ALB & NLB - Deregistration Delay

## **Auto Scaling Group**

- Like RelicaSets in k8s
- Min/Desired/Max Capacity
- Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
- Scaling Policies
    - Avg CPU
    - Custom metric on CloudWatch (CPU, Mem, Networking, Connections)
- Scheduled Actions - Increase / decrease at specific time
- Predictive scaling - continuously forecast load and schedule scaling ahead
- Scaling Cooldowns - cooldown period when scaling activity happens
