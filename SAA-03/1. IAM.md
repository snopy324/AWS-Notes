# **1. IAM - Identity and Access Management**


### **Components**

- **User**: map to physical user
- **Group**: only contains User, not other Groups
- **Users**: can be in no Group or multiple Group
- **Permission**: User or Group assigned permission by JSON called policies.
    
    ```json
    {
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement":[
          {
             "Effect":"Allow",
             "Action":"ec2:Describe*",
             "Resource":"*"
          },
          {
             "Effect":"Allow",
             "Action":"elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
             "Resource":"*"
          },
          {
             "Effect":"Allow",
             "Action":[
                "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
                "cloudwatch:Describe*"
             ],
             "Resource":"*"
          }
       ]
    }
    ```
    

## **Password Policy**

- **Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)**: like 2FA in TrendMicro
- **Role**: for AWS service to perform action on user's behalf (often used in EC2 and Lambda)
- **IAM Security Tools**
    - **IAM Credentials Report** (account level as root account) - list all users and status of various credentials
    - **IAM Access Advisor** (user level as IAM user) - list user credentials last accessed.

### Guidelines & Best Practices

1. Root account only used for AWS account setup, nothing more.
2. One AM user map to one physical uer
3. Users assign to groups at all time, permissions set on group level
4. Audit permissions of account with the
